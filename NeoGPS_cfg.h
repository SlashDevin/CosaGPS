/**
 * Enable/disable packed data structures.
 *
 * Enabling packed data structures will use two less-portable language
 * features of GCC to reduce RAM requirements.  Although it was expected to slightly increase execution time and code size, the reverse is true on 8-bit AVRs: the code is smaller and faster with packing enabled.
 *
 * Disabling packed data structures will be very portable to other
 * platforms.  NeoGPS configurations will use slightly more RAM, and on
 * 8-bit AVRs, the speed is slightly slower, and the code is slightly
 * larger.  There may be no choice but to disable packing on processors 
 * that do not support packed structures.
 *
 * There may also be compiler-specific switches that affect packing and the
 * code which accesses packed members.  YMMV.
