CosaGPS
======

This fully-configurable [Cosa](https://github.com/mikaelpatel/Cosa) library uses _**minimal**_ RAM, PROGMEM and CPU time, 
requiring as few as _**10 bytes of RAM**_, **866 bytes of PROGMEM**, and **less than 1mS of CPU time** per sentence.

It supports the following protocols and messages:

####NMEA 0183
* GPGGA - GPS system fix data
* GPGLL - Geographic Latitude and Longitude
* GPGSA - GPS/GNSS DOP and active satellites
* GPGST - GNSS Pseudo Range Error Statistics
* GPGSV - GPS/GNSS Satellites in View
* GPRMC - Recommended Minimum specific GPS/Transit data
* GPVTG - Course over ground and Ground speed
* GPZDA - UTC Time and Date

####u-blox NEO-6
#####NMEA 0183 Protocol Messages
* UBX,00 - Lat/Long Position Data
* UBX,04 - Time of Day and Clock Information

#####UBX Protocol Messages
* NAV_STATUS - Receiver Navigation Status
* NAV_TIMEGPS - GPS Time Solution
* NAV_TIMEUTC - UTC Time Solution
* NAV_POSLLH - Geodetic Position Solution
* NAV_VELNED - Velocity Solution in NED (North/East/Down)
* NAV_SVINFO - Space Vehicle Information

(The plain Arduino implementation is available [here](https://github.com/SlashDevin/NeoGPS).)

Goals
======
In an attempt to be reusable in a variety of different programming styles, this library supports:
* resource-constrained environments (e.g., ATTINY targets)
* sync or async operation (main `loop()` vs interrupt processing)
* event or polling (Event::Handler vs. fix() call)
* single, fused or coherent fixes (multiple reports into one)
* optional buffering of fixes
* optional floating point
* configurable message sets, including hooks for implementing proprietary NMEA messages
* configurable message fields
* multiple protocols from same device
* any kind of input stream (Serial, SoftwareSerial, PROGMEM arrays, etc.)

Inconceivable!
