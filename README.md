CosaGPS
======

This fully-configurable [Cosa](https://github.com/mikaelpatel/Cosa) library uses _**minimal**_ RAM and CPU time, 
requiring as few as _**10 bytes of RAM**_.  It supports the following protocols:
####NMEA 0183
* GPGGA - GPS system fix data
* GPGLL - Geographic Latitude and Longitude
* GPGSA - GPS/GNSS DOP and active satellites
* GPGST - GNSS Pseudo Range Error Statistics
* GPGSV - GPS/GNSS Satellites in View
* GPRMC - Recommended Minimum specific GPS/Transit data
* GPVTG - Course over ground and Ground speed
* GPZDA - UTC Time and Date

####u-blox NEO-6
* NAV_STATUS - Receiver Navigation Status
* NAV_TIMEGPS - GPS Time Solution
* NAV_TIMEUTC - UTC Time Solution
* NAV_POSLLH - Geodetic Position Solution
* NAV_VELNED - Velocity Solution in NED (North/East/Down)
* NAV_SVINFO - Space Vehicle Information

(The plain vanilla Arduino implementation is available [here](https://github.com/SlashDevin/NeoGPS).)

Goals
======
In an attempt to be reusable in a variety of different programming styles, this library supports:
* resource-constrained environments (e.g., ATTINY targets)
* sync or async operation (main `loop()` vs interrupt processing)
* event or polling (Event::Handler vs. fix() call)
* fused or not fused (multiple reports into one fix)
* optional buffering of fixes
* optional floating point
* configurable message sets, including hooks for implementing proprietary NMEA messages
* configurable message fields
* multiple protocols from same device

Data Model
==========
Rather than holding onto individual fields, the concept of a **fix** is used to group data members of the GPS acquisition.
This also facilitates the merging of separately received packets into a coherent position.  The members of `gps_fix` include 
* fix status
* date
* time
* latitude and longitude
* altitude
* speed
* heading
* number of satellites
* horizontal, vertical and position dilutions of precision (HDOP, VDOP and PDOP)
* latitude, longitude and altitude error in centimeters

Constellation Information is also available in the GPS instance:
* satellite ID, azimuth, elevation and SNR

Except for `status`, each member is conditionally compiled; any, all, or *no* members can be selected for parsing, storing and fusing.  This allows configuring an application to use the minimum amount of RAM for the particular `fix` members of interest:

* Separate validity flag for each member.
* Integers are used for all members, retaining full precision of the original data.
* Optional floating-point accessors are provided.
* `operator |=` can be used to merge two fixes:
```
NMEAGPS gps_device;
gps_fix_t merged;
.
.
.
merged |= gps_device.fix();
```

RAM requirements
=======
As data is received from the device, various portions of a `fix` are modified.  In 
fact, _**no buffering RAM is required**_.  Each character affects the internal state machine and may 
also contribute to a data member (e.g., latitude).

The minimal `fix` configuration requires only 2 bytes, and the NMEA state machine requires 
7 bytes, for a total of **10 bytes** (structure alignment may add 1 byte).

A nominal `fix` configuration requires only 34 bytes, for a total of **43 bytes**.  For comparison, TinyGPS requires about 180 bytes (120 bytes for members plus about 60 bytes of string data).

The complete `fix` configuration requires 44 bytes, and the full NMEA message set configuration adds 130 bytes of satellite data, for a total of **174 bytes**.

For example, if your application only requires an accurate one pulse-per-second, you 
can configure it to parse *no* sentence types and retain *no* data members.  Although the 
`fix().status` can be checked, no valid flags are available.  Even 
though no sentences are parsed and no data members are stored, the application will 
still receive a `decoded` message type once per second:
```
while (uart1.available())
  if (gps.decode( uart1.getchar() )) {
    if (gps.nmeaMessage == NMEAGPS::NMEA_RMC)
      sentenceReceived();
  }
```

The `ubloxGPS` derived class adds 20 bytes to handle the more-complicated protocol, 
plus 5 static bytes for converting GPS time and Time Of Week to UTC.

Examples
======
Several programs are provided to demonstrate how to use the classes in these different styles:

* [CosaNMEA](examples/CosaNMEA.ino) - sync, polled, not fused, standard NMEA only
* [CosaNMEAdevice](examples/CosaNMEAdevice.ino) - async, polled, fused, standard NMEA only
* [CosaNMEAevent](examples/CosaNMEAevent.ino) - async, event, fused, standard NMEA only
* [CosaPUBX](examples/CosaPUBX.ino) - sync, polled, not fused, standard NMEA + ublox proprietary NMEA
* [Cosaublox](examples/Cosaublox.ino) - sync, polled, fused, ublox protocol
* [CosaNMEAtest.ino](examples/CosaNMEAtest.ino) - sync, polled, not fused, standard NMEA only (This is a self-test program.  Various strings are passed to `decode` and the expected pass or fail results are displayed.  No GPS device is required.)

Preprocessor symbol `USE_FLOAT` can be used in [GPSfix.cpp](GPSfix.cpp) to select integer or floating-point output.
